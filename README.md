NanoDataCenter is the name of my Farm Automation Software Efforts.  
•	My blog for my efforts is at farmautomation.org.
•	The name NanoDataCenter comes from my realization that software at a farm site has some of the features of a cloud data center, hence the name nanodatacenter for github organization.
•	I gave a presentation at the 2018 Redis Conference on the subject.  The github link for this presentation is:
•	https://github.com/NanoDataCenter/nano_data_center/blob/master/presentations/Application%20of%20Redis%20to%20IOT%20Gateway%20Devices%20Final.pptx
•	This code base for this presentation is as follows: https://github.com/NanoDataCenter/nano_data_center
•	This code has been in production on my farm for over 2.5 years.
•	The code in this base is frozen as I come to realize that packaging applications in containers is the next move.
•	The github site which describes the docker framework based upon my past efforts is:
•	https://github.com/NanoDataCenter/edge_kubernetes
•	This site will detail the projects used for this effort
And finally, I am a sole person doing the whole operation.  I come from an embedded environment and I am learning as I go.
